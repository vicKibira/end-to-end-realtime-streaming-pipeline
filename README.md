**Real-Time Data Streaming with Kafka, Docker, and Python**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end real-time data streaming application using Kafka, Docker, and Python. It involves setting up a Kafka cluster with Docker, producing real-time data streams with a Python script, and consuming and processing these streams with another Python script. This project showcases the integration of Kafka for real-time data streaming, Docker for containerization, and Python for data handling and processing.
